# Exercise 2:
# Write a program called age.rb that asks a user how old they are
# and then tells them how old they will be in 10, 20, 30 and 40 years.
# Below is the output for someone 20 years old.

puts 'How old are you?'

In 30 years you will be:
#{age + 30}
In 40 years you will be:
#{age + 40}"
